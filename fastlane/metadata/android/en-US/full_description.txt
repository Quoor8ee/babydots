Based on experience with our young daughter, showing sharp contrasting dots along with calming music soothes her. It can take her from a distressed state to happy and content almost immediately. We started showing baby dots from 10 weeks old, and it still worked well at 8 months old.

Works at home and on the go.

Although it may not work for every baby, we hope it helps yours.
